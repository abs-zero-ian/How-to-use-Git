This is simply a place where I will note down how I use Git so that I don't forget when I inevitably leave it alone for a while.

If useful, feel free to fork and if you find anything isn't correct, please fork, amend and push any corrections.  

Or, as sometimes there are simply different styles rather than outright best practice, show me easier ways to do things. :-)

I've initially used an OpenDocument format for the file, but realise this doesn't lend itself to collaborative work so I might convert it to a Markdown Readme file and see if that works any better...
